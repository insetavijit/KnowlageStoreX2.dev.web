| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[[2.3.1 DL Element Basics]]**          | Introduce the **`<dl>` element** as the description/definition list container: semantic meaning for term-description pairs, block-level behavior, and distinction from ul/ol lists.                                               |
| **[[2.3.2 DT Element (Term)]]**          | Explain the **`<dt>` element** as the definition term: the word, phrase, or concept being defined; inline content allowed, multiple dt elements can precede a single dd, and proper term markup.                                  |
| **[[2.3.3 DD Element (Description)]]**   | Detail the **`<dd>` element** as the definition description: the explanation or value associated with dt; block-level content allowed, multiple dd elements can follow a single dt, default indentation behavior.                 |
| **[[2.3.4 Term-Description Patterns]]**  | Cover **grouping patterns**: one term to one description, one term to multiple descriptions, multiple terms to one description; proper nesting and semantic relationship representation.                                          |
| **[[2.3.5 Glossary Use Case]]**          | Apply dl for **glossaries and dictionaries**: alphabetical term lists, technical vocabulary, acronym expansions; proper semantic structure for reference content and accessibility benefits.                                       |
| **[[2.3.6 Metadata Use Case]]**          | Apply dl for **key-value metadata**: author-name pairs, date-value pairs, specification tables; when dl semantics are more appropriate than tables for presenting associative data.                                               |
| **[[2.3.7 FAQ Use Case]]**               | Apply dl for **question-answer formatting**: FAQ pages, interview transcripts, dialog representation; dt for questions, dd for answers, and accessibility considerations for this pattern.                                        |
| **[[2.3.8 DL Accessibility]]**           | Detail **screen reader behavior** with definition lists: announcing terms and descriptions, navigation between pairs, when dl structure aids comprehension vs when alternatives are better.                                       |
| **[[2.3.9 Styling Definition Lists]]**   | Cover **CSS for dl styling**: controlling dt/dd display, inline vs block layouts, grid-based term-description alignment, removing default dd indentation, creating visual term-description relationships.                         |
| **[[2.3.10 When Not to Use DL]]**        | Clarify **appropriate vs inappropriate uses**: not for dialog/conversation (use other markup), not for layout purposes, not when terms aren't actually being defined; choosing semantic accuracy over convenience.                |
