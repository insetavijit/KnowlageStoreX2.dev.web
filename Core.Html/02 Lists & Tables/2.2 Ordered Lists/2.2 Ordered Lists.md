| **[[2.2.1 OL Element Basics]]**          | Introduce the **`<ol>` element** as the ordered list container: semantic meaning of sequential/ranked items, default numbering, block-level behavior, and when ordered lists properly convey meaning.                             |
| **[[2.2.2 Numbering Types]]**            | Explain the **type attribute** for numbering styles: `1` (decimal), `a` (lowercase), `A` (uppercase), `i` (roman), `I` (uppercase roman); when each type is appropriate and CSS alternatives.                                     |
| **[[2.2.3 Start Attribute]]**            | Detail the **start attribute** for custom starting numbers: resuming lists after interruptions, legal document numbering (starting at specific section), and how start value affects all subsequent items.                        |
| **[[2.2.4 Reversed Attribute]]**         | Explain the **reversed attribute** for countdown lists: top-10 rankings, priority ordering from lowest to highest, automatic decrementing, and combining reversed with start for specific ranges.                                 |
| **[[2.2.5 Value Attribute on LI]]**      | Cover the **value attribute** on individual li elements: overriding sequence at specific points, non-sequential numbering patterns, legal outline formats (1, 2, 2a, 2b, 3), and mixing numbered sequences.                       |
| **[[2.2.6 Nested Ordered Lists]]**       | Detail **nesting ol within li**: hierarchical numbered structures, automatic sub-numbering patterns, legal/academic outline formats, and controlling type at each nesting level for proper document structure.                    |
| **[[2.2.7 Semantic Numbering]]**         | Distinguish **meaningful sequence vs arbitrary order**: steps that must be followed in order, ranked items, chronological events; when the number itself carries meaning vs presentational preference.                             |
| **[[2.2.8 OL Accessibility]]**           | Detail **screen reader behavior** with ordered lists: announcing "list of X items", conveying position (1 of 5), importance of sequence communication, and when list semantics aid user comprehension.                            |
| **[[2.2.9 Styling Ordered Lists]]**      | Cover **CSS for ol styling**: list-style-type values, counters for complex numbering, removing numbers for sublists, counter-increment/counter-reset for advanced sequential patterns.                                            |
| **[[2.2.10 Practical Examples]]**        | Provide **real-world implementations**: recipe steps, installation instructions, top-10 lists, legal document outlines, academic paper numbering; demonstrating proper semantic structure with each use case.                     |
