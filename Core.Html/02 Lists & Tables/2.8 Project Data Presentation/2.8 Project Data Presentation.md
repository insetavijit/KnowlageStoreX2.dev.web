| **[[2.8.1 Project Overview]]**                 | Establish **project goals and scope**: building a resume using lists and a weekly schedule using tables; combining semantic markup with accessibility; demonstrating real-world application of module concepts.                   |
| **[[2.8.2 Resume Structure Planning]]**        | Plan the **resume layout**: sections for contact, summary, experience, education, skills; identifying appropriate list types for each section; sketching the document hierarchy before coding.                                    |
| **[[2.8.3 Building the Skills Section]]**      | Implement **skills with unordered lists**: categorizing skills (technical, soft, tools), nested lists for skill groups, proper semantic markup, and styling for visual presentation.                                              |
| **[[2.8.4 Building the Experience Section]]**  | Implement **work history with lists**: company/role as headings, responsibilities as ul items, achievements with emphasis, date formatting, and creating scannable professional content.                                          |
| **[[2.8.5 Building the Education Section]]**   | Implement **education with definition lists**: institution as dt, degree and details as dd; alternative list approaches; handling certifications and courses; semantic accuracy for credentials.                                  |
| **[[2.8.6 Schedule Table Planning]]**          | Plan the **weekly schedule table**: days as columns, time slots as rows, identifying header structure, planning for merged cells (multi-hour events), and sketching the data grid.                                                |
| **[[2.8.7 Building the Schedule Table]]**      | Implement the **schedule with proper structure**: thead for day headers, tbody for time rows, th for time column, colspan for spanning events, and maintaining grid integrity.                                                    |
| **[[2.8.8 Schedule Accessibility]]**           | Apply **accessibility to the schedule**: scope attributes for headers, caption describing the schedule, testing with screen reader, ensuring time-day relationships are clear to all users.                                       |
| **[[2.8.9 Styling the Projects]]**             | Apply **CSS to both projects**: resume formatting for print and screen, schedule table styling with borders and zebra stripes, responsive considerations, and professional visual presentation.                                   |
| **[[2.8.10 Validation and Review]]**           | Perform **final quality check**: W3C validation, accessibility audit, cross-browser testing, reviewing semantic correctness, confirming all module concepts properly applied; project completion criteria.                        |
