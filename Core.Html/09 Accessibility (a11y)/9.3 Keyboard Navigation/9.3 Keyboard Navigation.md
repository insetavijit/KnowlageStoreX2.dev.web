| **[[9.3.1 Keyboard Navigation Importance]]** | Explain **why keyboard access matters**: users with motor disabilities, screen reader users, power users, and keyboard as foundation of accessible interaction.                                                                   |
| **[[9.3.2 Natural Tab Order]]**              | Cover **default tab order**: DOM order determines keyboard flow, logical content order, source order reflecting intended flow, and maintaining natural tabbing.                                                                   |
| **[[9.3.3 Tabindex Deep Dive]]**             | Detail **tabindex attribute**: tabindex="0" for custom interactive elements, negative tabindex for programmatic focus only, avoiding positive tabindex values, and tabindex best practices.                                       |
| **[[9.3.4 Focus Indicators]]**               | Explain **visible focus requirement**: default focus outlines, never remove focus without replacement, designing custom focus styles, and focus indicator WCAG requirements.                                                      |
| **[[9.3.5 Skip Links]]**                     | Cover **skip navigation links**: skip-to-main pattern, visible on focus, bypassing repetitive content, and skip link implementation.                                                                                              |
| **[[9.3.6 Keyboard Traps]]**                 | Explain **avoiding keyboard traps**: user must be able to navigate away, modal focus containment (intentional), escape routes, and testing for traps.                                                                             |
| **[[9.3.7 Interactive Element Keyboard Support]]** | Detail **keyboard patterns for widgets**: buttons (Enter/Space), links (Enter), form controls, and ensuring all interactive elements are keyboard operable.                                                                  |
| **[[9.3.8 Focus Management]]**               | Cover **managing focus programmatically**: moving focus to new content, returning focus after dialogs, focus on route changes, and appropriate focus management patterns.                                                         |
| **[[9.3.9 Keyboard-Only Testing]]**          | Provide **keyboard testing method**: navigate with Tab/Shift+Tab, activate with Enter/Space, use arrow keys, identify issues, and keyboard testing checklist.                                                                     |
| **[[9.3.10 Common Keyboard Issues]]**        | Identify **frequent keyboard problems**: focus not visible, custom controls not focusable, unexpected tab order, focus disappearing, and debugging keyboard issues.                                                               |
