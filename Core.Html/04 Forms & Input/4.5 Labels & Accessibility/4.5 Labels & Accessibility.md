| **[[4.5.1 Label Association Methods]]**      | Compare **explicit vs implicit labels**: for/id association, wrapping inputs in labels, pros and cons of each approach, and ensuring every input has an accessible label.                                                         |
| **[[4.5.2 Label Best Practices]]**           | Establish **effective label patterns**: visible labels always, descriptive text, label position conventions (above vs beside), and labels as primary accessibility mechanism.                                                     |
| **[[4.5.3 Placeholder vs Label]]**           | Distinguish **placeholder from label**: placeholder for hints not labels, placeholder disappearing problems, accessibility issues with placeholder-only, and proper combined usage.                                               |
| **[[4.5.4 Fieldset and Legend Usage]]**      | Detail **group labeling with fieldset/legend**: when grouping is necessary (radio groups, related fields), legend as group name for screen readers, and nested fieldset considerations.                                           |
| **[[4.5.5 ARIA Labels for Forms]]**          | Cover **ARIA labeling attributes**: aria-label for invisible labels, aria-labelledby for complex labels, aria-describedby for additional instructions, and when ARIA supplements native labeling.                                 |
| **[[4.5.6 Error Message Accessibility]]**    | Detail **accessible error handling**: associating errors with inputs (aria-describedby), aria-invalid attribute, error announcement timing, and error recovery guidance.                                                          |
| **[[4.5.7 Required Field Indication]]**      | Establish **required field patterns**: visual required indicators, programmatic required attribute, aria-required for ARIA widgets, and communicating optional vs required clearly.                                               |
| **[[4.5.8 Form Instructions]]**              | Cover **providing form instructions**: format hints, password requirements, contextual help; placement and association with inputs, and avoiding instruction overload.                                                            |
| **[[4.5.9 Focus Management]]**               | Detail **focus handling in forms**: logical tab order, focus indication, moving focus to errors, autofocus considerations, and keyboard-navigable form flows.                                                                     |
| **[[4.5.10 Screen Reader Form Experience]]** | Explain **how screen readers traverse forms**: forms mode, field-by-field navigation, how labels/legends/descriptions are announced, and testing forms with screen readers.                                                       |
