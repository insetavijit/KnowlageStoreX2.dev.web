| **[[5.8.1 Project Overview]]**               | Establish **media gallery project goals**: building image gallery, video player, and audio playlist with proper accessibility, responsive design, and optimization; demonstrating module concepts.                                |
| **[[5.8.2 Gallery Structure Planning]]**     | Plan the **gallery layout**: grid of images, lightbox/modal pattern, thumbnail vs full-size, responsive grid considerations, and semantic structure for image collections.                                                        |
| **[[5.8.3 Building the Image Grid]]**        | Implement the **image gallery grid**: responsive CSS grid, figure elements for images with captions, lazy loading for performance, and thumbnail presentation.                                                                    |
| **[[5.8.4 Responsive Image Implementation]]**| Apply **responsive images** to gallery: srcset for different sizes, picture element for art direction, proper sizing for grid layout, and optimized image delivery.                                                               |
| **[[5.8.5 Building the Video Player]]**      | Implement a **video section**: video element with controls, poster image, multiple source formats, captions with track element, and accessible video presentation.                                                                |
| **[[5.8.6 Building the Audio Playlist]]**    | Implement an **audio section**: multiple audio elements, playlist structure, audio controls, track information display, and navigable audio collection.                                                                           |
| **[[5.8.7 SVG Icons and Graphics]]**         | Add **SVG elements** to the gallery: play button icons, navigation arrows, inline SVG implementation, accessible icon usage, and visual enhancement with vectors.                                                                 |
| **[[5.8.8 Accessibility Implementation]]**   | Apply **accessibility best practices**: alt text for all images, captions for video, transcripts for audio, keyboard navigation, focus management, and screen reader testing.                                                     |
| **[[5.8.9 Performance Optimization]]**       | Implement **media optimization**: lazy loading all media, compressed formats, appropriate dimensions, preload strategies, and measuring gallery performance.                                                                      |
| **[[5.8.10 Responsive Design and Testing]]** | Apply **responsive layout and validation**: mobile-first gallery design, testing across devices, cross-browser verification, final accessibility audit, and project completion.                                                   |
