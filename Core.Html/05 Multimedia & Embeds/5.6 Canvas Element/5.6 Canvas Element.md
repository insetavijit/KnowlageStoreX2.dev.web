| **[[5.6.1 Canvas Element Basics]]**          | Introduce the **`<canvas>` element**: raster graphics surface, width and height attributes, fallback content, and canvas as 2D/3D drawing surface for JavaScript.                                                                 |
| **[[5.6.2 Canvas Context]]**                 | Explain **getting rendering context**: getContext('2d') for 2D graphics, getContext('webgl') for 3D, context as the drawing API, and understanding context concept.                                                               |
| **[[5.6.3 Drawing Shapes]]**                 | Cover **2D context shape methods**: fillRect, strokeRect, clearRect, beginPath, arc, moveTo, lineTo, fill, stroke; creating basic shapes programmatically.                                                                        |
| **[[5.6.4 Canvas Styling]]**                 | Detail **styling canvas drawings**: fillStyle, strokeStyle, lineWidth, lineCap, lineJoin; gradients (createLinearGradient, createRadialGradient), and patterns.                                                                   |
| **[[5.6.5 Drawing Text]]**                   | Explain **text on canvas**: fillText, strokeText, font property, textAlign, textBaseline, measureText for positioning, and creating text-based canvas graphics.                                                                   |
| **[[5.6.6 Drawing Images]]**                 | Cover **images on canvas**: drawImage with various overloads, image sources (img, video, another canvas), cropping and scaling, and compositing images.                                                                           |
| **[[5.6.7 Canvas Transformations]]**         | Detail **transform methods**: translate, rotate, scale, transform matrix, save/restore context state, and creating complex positioned graphics.                                                                                   |
| **[[5.6.8 Canvas Animation]]**               | Explain **animating canvas**: requestAnimationFrame loop, clearing and redrawing, frame timing, performance considerations, and creating smooth canvas animations.                                                                |
| **[[5.6.9 Canvas Accessibility]]**           | Address **canvas accessibility challenges**: canvas is inaccessible by default, fallback content importance, sub-DOM for accessibility, and when to avoid canvas for accessible content.                                          |
| **[[5.6.10 Canvas Use Cases]]**              | Provide **practical canvas applications**: charts and graphs, games, image manipulation, signatures, data visualization, and understanding when canvas is the right tool.                                                         |
