| **[[6.8.6 Progress Tracking]]**              | Implement **reading progress**: tracking which FAQs have been viewed, using data attributes for state, progress element for completion percentage, and gamified FAQ experience.                                                   |
| **[[6.8.7 Adding Data Attributes]]**         | Apply **data-* for metadata**: data-category, data-viewed, data-faq-id; JavaScript interaction with data attributes, and enriching FAQ with custom data.                                                                          |

| **[[6.8.10 Enhancement and Review]]**        | Complete **final enhancements**: search/filter functionality (optional), mobile responsiveness, cross-browser testing, code validation, and project completion.                                                                   |
