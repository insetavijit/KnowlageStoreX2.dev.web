| **[[3.1.1 What Are Semantic Elements]]**     | Define **semantic HTML elements** as tags that convey meaning about their content: distinguishing from generic div/span, how semantics describe purpose rather than appearance, and the shift from presentational to meaningful markup. |
| **[[3.1.2 Semantic vs Non-Semantic]]**       | Compare **semantic elements** (header, nav, article) with **non-semantic** elements (div, span): when each is appropriate, refactoring div-soup to semantic structure, and identifying semantic opportunities in existing code.   |
| **[[3.1.3 Benefits for Accessibility]]**     | Explain how **semantic elements aid assistive technologies**: landmark navigation, screen reader announcements, skip-to-content functionality, and how semantics create navigable document structure for users with disabilities.  |
| **[[3.1.4 Benefits for SEO]]**               | Detail **SEO advantages of semantic markup**: search engine content understanding, featured snippet extraction, improved crawlability, how semantics signal content hierarchy and importance to ranking algorithms.               |
| **[[3.1.5 Benefits for Maintainability]]**   | Cover **developer experience benefits**: self-documenting code, easier navigation in large codebases, clearer component boundaries, reduced need for comments when elements describe their purpose.                               |
| **[[3.1.6 HTML5 Semantic Elements List]]**   | Provide a **comprehensive list** of HTML5 semantic elements: structural (header, nav, main, footer), content (article, section, aside), text-level (time, mark, figure); overview of the semantic vocabulary available.          |
| **[[3.1.7 Browser Support and Fallbacks]]**  | Address **browser compatibility** for semantic elements: universal modern support, legacy IE considerations, HTML5shiv for older browsers, why fallbacks are rarely needed today.                                                 |
| **[[3.1.8 Common Misconceptions]]**          | Clarify **misunderstandings about semantics**: semantic elements don't provide styling, multiple headers/footers are valid, article vs section confusion, and that semantics are about meaning not visual design.                 |
| **[[3.1.9 Semantic Validation]]**            | Explain how to **validate semantic usage**: document outline tools, accessibility checkers detecting landmark regions, manual review for appropriate element selection, and common validation warnings.                           |
| **[[3.1.10 Transitioning to Semantic HTML]]**| Guide **refactoring non-semantic markup**: identifying div patterns that should be semantic, incremental migration strategies, testing accessibility after changes, and maintaining functionality during transition.              |
