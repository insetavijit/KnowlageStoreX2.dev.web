| **[[1.4.1 Heading Elements (h1-h6)]]**   | Explain the **six heading levels** and their semantic importance: h1 as primary page heading, hierarchical structure, accessibility implications for screen readers, SEO impact, and proper heading usage patterns.                 |
| **[[1.4.2 Paragraph Element]]**          | Define the **`<p>` element** as the fundamental text container: automatic spacing, block-level behavior, semantic meaning for text blocks, and how browsers handle whitespace within paragraphs.                                    |
| **[[1.4.3 Line Breaks]]**                | Explain the **`<br>` element** for line breaks within content: appropriate use cases (addresses, poetry), self-closing syntax, when NOT to use breaks for spacing, and the difference between semantic vs presentational breaks.    |
| **[[1.4.4 Horizontal Rules]]**           | Cover the **`<hr>` element** as a thematic break: semantic meaning of content separation, visual presentation, appropriate use cases (section breaks, topic shifts), and accessibility considerations.                              |
| **[[1.4.5 HTML Comments]]**              | Detail **comment syntax** (`<!-- -->`) for documentation: commenting out code, leaving developer notes, conditional comments (legacy), and best practices for maintaining readable, documented HTML.                                |
| **[[1.4.6 Whitespace Handling]]**        | Explain how browsers **process whitespace**: collapsing multiple spaces, handling newlines in source code, when whitespace matters (pre element), and controlling whitespace with CSS when needed.                                  |
| **[[1.4.7 Text Content Basics]]**        | Provide foundational understanding of **text in HTML**: how text nodes work, mixing text with elements, entity characters for special symbols, and the relationship between source code formatting and rendered output.             |
| **[[1.4.8 Block vs Inline Elements]]**   | Distinguish **block-level and inline elements**: default display behaviors, how blocks stack and inlines flow, nesting rules (block in inline is invalid), and how this fundamental concept affects page layout.                    |
| **[[1.4.9 Generic Containers (div)]]**   | Introduce the **`<div>` element** as a generic block container: use for grouping, styling hooks, layout purposes, and why divs should be replaced with semantic elements when possible.                                             |
| **[[1.4.10 Generic Inline (span)]]**     | Introduce the **`<span>` element** as a generic inline container: use for styling portions of text, applying classes to text fragments, and maintaining inline flow while enabling targeted styling.                                |
