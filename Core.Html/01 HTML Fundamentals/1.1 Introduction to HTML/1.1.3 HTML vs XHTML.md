|**1.1.3 HTML vs XHTML**|Compare syntax rules and parsing models of HTML vs XHTML|SGML vs XML lineage, draconian error handling, MIME types|XHTML imposed strict XML rules; HTML5 adopted lenient parsing.|
|**[[1.1.3.1 Syntax Strictness]]**|Contrast lenient HTML with strict XHTML rules|Self-closing tags, case sensitivity, quoted attributes|XHTML requires perfect syntax; HTML is forgiving.|
|**[[1.1.3.2 Error Handling]]**|Explain how browsers react to errors in each|Draconian error handling (XML) vs Quirk/Standards mode (HTML)|XML breaks on error; HTML tries to render anyway.|
|**[[1.1.3.3 MIME Types]]**|Technical distinction in delivery|`application/xhtml+xml` vs `text/html`|Real XHTML must be served with the XML MIME type.|
|**[[1.1.3.4 Legacy & Compatibility]]**|Why XHTML didn't take over the web|Backward compatibility issues, IE support limitations|Strict XML broke too many existing sites to succeed.|
|**[[1.1.3.5 When to use XML syntax]]**|Valid use cases for XML-style syntax|SVG, MathML, Polyglot markup (historical)|XML syntax is still used for embedded vector graphics (SVG).|
|**[[1.1.3.6 The "Polyglot" Markup]]**|Writing HTML that parses as both|Writing valid XML-compatible HTML5 (e.g., closing all tags)|Polyglot markup bridges the gap but is largely unnecessary today.|
