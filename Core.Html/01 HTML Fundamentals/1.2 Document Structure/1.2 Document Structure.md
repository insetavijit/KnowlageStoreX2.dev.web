| **[[1.2.1 DOCTYPE Declaration]]**         | Explain the **purpose of DOCTYPE** as the document type declaration that triggers standards mode; cover HTML5 simplified `<!DOCTYPE html>` vs legacy doctypes and how browsers interpret rendering mode based on this directive. |
| **[[1.2.2 The HTML Element]]**            | Define the **root `<html>` element** as the container for all page content; cover the `lang` attribute for accessibility/SEO, and how it establishes the document tree structure for the DOM.                                    |
| **[[1.2.3 The Head Section]]**            | Describe the **`<head>` element** as the metadata container; explain its role in holding title, meta tags, links to stylesheets, scripts, and other resources invisible to users but essential for browsers and search engines.  |
| **[[1.2.4 Essential Meta Tags]]**         | Cover **critical meta elements**: charset encoding (`UTF-8`), viewport configuration for responsive design, description for SEO, and other common metadata that influences browser behavior and search indexing.                 |
| **[[1.2.5 The Title Element]]**           | Explain the **`<title>` element** as the document's name displayed in browser tabs, bookmarks, and search results; cover best practices for SEO-friendly, descriptive, and concise page titles.                                  |
| **[[1.2.6 The Body Section]]**            | Define the **`<body>` element** as the container for all visible page content; explain its relationship to the rendering viewport and how it serves as the parent for all structural and content elements.                       |
| **[[1.2.7 Character Encoding]]**          | Explain **character encoding fundamentals**: why `UTF-8` is the universal standard, how `<meta charset="UTF-8">` ensures proper text rendering, and consequences of encoding mismatches (mojibake).                              |
| **[[1.2.8 Viewport Meta Tag]]**           | Detail the **viewport meta tag** for responsive design: `width=device-width`, `initial-scale`, and how this directive controls layout on mobile devices; explain its critical role in mobile-first development.                  |
| **[[1.2.9 Basic Page Anatomy]]**          | Provide a **complete structural overview** of a minimal valid HTML5 document: doctype → html → head (meta, title) → body; illustrate how these building blocks form the foundation for all web pages.                            |
| **[[1.2.10 Document Rendering Pipeline]]** | Explain how browsers **parse and render** the HTML document structure: doctype triggers mode → head processed for resources → body parsed into DOM → layout and paint; connect structure to browser behavior.                    |
