| **[[7.2.1 Boolean Attribute Concept]]**      | Explain **boolean attribute syntax**: presence means true, absence means false, value doesn't determine state (disabled="false" is still disabled), and correct boolean attribute usage.                                          |
| **[[7.2.2 Common Boolean Attributes]]**      | List **frequently used booleans**: disabled, readonly, required, checked, selected, hidden, open, async, defer, multiple, autofocus, autoplay, controls, loop, muted, and their elements.                                         |
| **[[7.2.3 Disabled Attribute]]**             | Detail **disabled behavior**: prevents interaction, grays out controls, excluded from form submission, disabled on fieldset groups children, and disabled styling.                                                                |
| **[[7.2.4 Readonly Attribute]]**             | Explain **readonly behavior**: prevents editing but allows interaction, value IS submitted, difference from disabled, and readonly use cases (pre-filled forms, calculated values).                                               |
| **[[7.2.5 Required Attribute]]**             | Cover **required for validation**: prevents empty submission, HTML5 validation trigger, required visual indication, and required with validation states.                                                                          |
| **[[7.2.6 Checked and Selected]]**           | Detail **checked for checkboxes/radios** and **selected for options**: default selection state, JavaScript property vs attribute, and managing selection state.                                                                   |
| **[[7.2.7 Boolean Attributes in JavaScript]]**| Explain **JavaScript handling**: element.disabled = true/false, hasAttribute for presence, removeAttribute to unset, and the attribute/property distinction for booleans.                                                        |
| **[[7.2.8 Async and Defer]]**                | Cover **script loading booleans**: async for parallel loading/immediate execution, defer for parallel loading/ordered execution, and script loading optimization.                                                                 |
| **[[7.2.9 Boolean Attribute Serialization]]**| Detail **HTML serialization**: empty string equivalent to true, any value equivalent to true, proper minified HTML (attribute name only), and validation considerations.                                                          |
| **[[7.2.10 Common Mistakes]]**               | Address **boolean attribute errors**: disabled="false" doesn't enable, removing vs setting false, framework differences (React synthetic booleans), and debugging boolean attributes.                                             |
