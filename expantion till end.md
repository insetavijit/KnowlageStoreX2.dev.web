#### **Prompt Info**

- **Version:** v1.4-doc-subject-expansion
    
- **Date:** 2026-01-05
    
- **Purpose:** Complete all remaining subject sections using established documentation system rules
    

---

### **Objective**

Systematically generate **all remaining sections of the subject**, starting from **Section `03` through the final section**, using the **same documentation architecture, hierarchy rules, and quality standards** validated in Sections `01` and `02`.

---

### **Reference & Governance**

- Treat **`examination.md`** as the **canonical governance and lookback document**.
    
- Treat **completed Sections `01` and `02`** as the **authoritative reference model** for:
    
    - Section intent formulation
        
    - Subsection decomposition
        
    - Depth, tone, and progression
        

No new structural or semantic rules may be introduced unless explicitly required by subject matter boundaries.

---

### **Analytical Basis**

Before generating each new section:

- Analyze how prior sections:
    
    - Define section-level intent (`0X.md`)
        
    - Decompose into ordered subsections (`X.1+`)
        
- Infer:
    
    - Subject progression logic
        
    - Cross-section continuity rules
        
    - Increasing or stable depth expectations
        

---

### **Generation Rules (For Each New Section)**

For each section `0X` (where `X ≥ 3`):

- Create:
    
    - `0X.md` as the section-level parent
        
    - All required child files (`X.1.md`, `X.2.md`, … until the section is complete)
        
- Ensure:
    
    - Structural parity with Sections `01` and `02`
        
    - Clear, non-overlapping scopes within the section
        
    - Logical sequencing aligned with subject learning progression
        

---

### **Cross-Section Constraints**

- No content duplication across sections
    
- No forward references to undefined sections
    
- Terminology must remain consistent across the subject
    
- Each section must stand independently while contributing to the whole
    

---

### **Output Constraints**

- All files must:
    
    - Follow the established document skeleton
        
    - Contain content only (no governance or meta commentary)
        
    - Assume `examination.md` as implicit context
        

---

### **Completion Criteria**

The subject is considered complete when:

- All sections from `03` to the final section are generated
    
- Each section:
    
    - Mirrors the quality and structure of earlier sections
        
    - Integrates cleanly into the subject hierarchy
        
- The full subject can be reviewed end-to-end without structural ambiguity
