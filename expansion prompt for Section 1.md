#### **Prompt Info**

- **Version:** v1.2-doc-expansion
    
- **Date:** 2026-01-05
    
- **Purpose:** Generate remaining subsection documents for Section `01` using established structural and semantic rules
    

---

### **Objective**

Systematically generate all remaining Markdown files for **Section `01`** (`1.2`, `1.3`, `1.4`, … until the end of the section), ensuring they are **structurally and semantically consistent** with `1.1`.

---

### **Reference & Governance**

- Treat **`examination.md`** as the **canonical lookback and governance document**.
    
- Do **not** redefine rules already specified in `examination.md`
    
- All generation decisions must comply with:
    
    - Defined hierarchy rules
        
    - Numbering and scope constraints
        
    - Content dependency model
        

---

### **Analytical Basis**

Before generating new files:

- Analyze the established relationship between:
    
    - **`01`** (section-level parent)
        
    - **`1.1`** (first child implementation)
        
- Infer and apply:
    
    - Structural patterns
        
    - Depth and granularity expectations
        
    - Tone, terminology, and progression logic
        

---

### **Generation Rules**

For each new file (`1.2+`):

- Treat it as a **sibling** of `1.1`
    
- Maintain:
    
    - Identical document skeleton
        
    - Comparable depth and explanatory rigor
        
    - Clear scope isolation (no overlap with siblings)
        
- Ensure:
    
    - Logical progression within Section `01`
        
    - No forward references to undefined sections
        

---

### **Output Requirements**

For each generated file:

- Use the **same structural template** as `1.1`
    
- Align content strictly to its subsection title and scope
    
- Do not restate global section intent already covered in `01`
    

---

### **Constraints**

- No deviation from `examination.md`
    
- No restructuring of Section `01`
    
- No meta commentary or justification in the output files
    
- Content only — governance stays in `examination.md`
    

---

### **Completion Criteria**

- All subsections of Section `01` are generated
    
- Each file:
    
    - Fits cleanly under `01`
        
    - Reads as part of a single, cohesive section
        
    - Could be reviewed independently without ambiguity
