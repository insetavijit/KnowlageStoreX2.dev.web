#### **Prompt Info**

- **Version:** v1.3-doc-section-parity
    
- **Date:** 2026-01-05
    
- **Purpose:** Generate a complete Section `02` using the validated design, rules, and patterns established in Section `01`
    

---

### **Objective**

Create and complete **Section `02`** by applying the **same documentation system, hierarchy rules, and generation standards** used to design and populate Section `01`.

---

### **Reference & Governance**

- Treat **`examination.md`** as the **primary governance document**.
    
- Treat **Section `01`** (including `01` and all `1.x` files) as the **authoritative structural and semantic reference model**.
    
- Do **not** introduce new structural rules unless explicitly required.
    

---

### **Analytical Basis**

Before generating content:

- Analyze how **Section `01`** was:
    
    - Structured at the section level (`01`)
        
    - Decomposed into subsections (`1.x`)
        
- Abstract the reusable patterns:
    
    - Section intent articulation
        
    - Subsection depth and granularity
        
    - Ordering and progression logic
        

---

### **Generation Rules for Section 02**

- Create:
    
    - `02` as the section-level parent
        
    - All required child files (`2.1`, `2.2`, `2.3`, … until the section is complete)
        
- Ensure:
    
    - Structural parity with Section `01`
        
    - Consistent tone, terminology, and rigor
        
    - Clear, non-overlapping scopes across subsections
        

---

### **Output Constraints**

- Each `2.x` file must:
    
    - Follow the same document skeleton used in `1.x`
        
    - Align directly with the intent of `02`
        
    - Avoid repeating global concepts already covered elsewhere
        
- No meta explanation in output files
    

---

### **Completion Criteria**

- Section `02` is fully populated
    
- All files:
    
    - Conform to `examination`
        
    - Mirror the quality and structure of Section `01`
        
    - Form a coherent, standalone section
