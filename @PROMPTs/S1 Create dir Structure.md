Use `*-syllabus.md` as the **only source of truth**.

For each **section** defined in `*-syllabus.md`:

1. Create a directory named exactly as:  
    **`<section number> <section title>`**  
    (title copied verbatim from the syllabus)
    
2. Inside that directory, create **one Markdown file** named exactly the same as the directory, with `.md` appended.
    
3. Populate the `.md` file with:
    
    - The section title (as a level-1 heading, exactly as in the syllabus)
        
    - The section description paragraph (verbatim from the syllabus)
        
    - The **complete topics table for that section** (all rows, unchanged)
        

Rules:

- Directory name and file name must match exactly (except `.md`)
    
- Do not create topic files or subfolders
    
- Do not rename, normalize, or reformat titles
    
- Do not add or remove table rows or columns
    
- Preserve section order exactly as in the syllabus
    
- Output only the directory tree and generated files
    
- No explanations or commentary
    

End.
