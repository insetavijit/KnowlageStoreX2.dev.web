#### **Prompt Info**

- **Version:** v1.0-doc-system
    
- **Date:** 2026-01-05
    
- **Purpose:** Structural analysis, hierarchy evaluation, and scalable documentation system design
    

---
### **@PROMPT**

Perform a structural analysis of the project directory and document its organizational rationale.

Evaluate the hierarchical and semantic relationship between the Markdown files `{01.md (parent)}` and `{1.1.md (child)}`, explicitly covering:

- Hierarchy and numbering schema
    
- Content scope boundaries
    
- Dependency and inheritance rules
    

Adopt the role of a **documentation system designer** and define the **standards, constraints, and generation process** for creating future files (`1.2+`) in a scalable and consistent manner.

Use the following **fixed documentation structure** when recording findings:

### **Required Structure (in order)**

1. **Role & Context**
    
2. **Project Intent & Directory Rationale**
    
3. **Parent–Child File Relationship (01 ↔ 1.1)**
    
4. **Numbering & Scope Rules**
    
5. **Content Dependency Model**
    
6. **Standards for Future Files (1.2+)**
    
7. **Constraints & Consistency Rules**
    
8. **Generation Process**
    
9. **Assumptions & Design Decisions**
    

Record all analysis, declared roles, assumptions, and design rules in **`examination.md`**, treating it as the **canonical reference document** for future documentation generation.
