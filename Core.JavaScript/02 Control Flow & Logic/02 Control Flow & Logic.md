# **[[02 Control Flow & Logic]]**

Master control structures for program logic. Learn conditionals, loops, and branching. Build decision-making algorithms and repetitive tasks. Control flow enables dynamic program behavior and is fundamental to all programming.

|Topic|Focus & Purpose|
|---|---|
|**[[2.1 If Statements]]**|if condition; if-else; else if; nested if; conditional logic; comparison operators; boolean expressions. Basic decisions.|
|**[[2.2 Switch Statements]]**|switch syntax; case statements; break; default; when to use switch vs if; multiple conditions. Multi-way branching.|
|**[[2.3 Ternary Operator]]**|condition ? true : false; nested ternary; use cases; readability considerations; shorthand conditionals. Inline decisions.|
|**[[2.4 For Loops]]**|for loop syntax; initialization; condition; increment; loop control; break and continue; nested loops. Repetition control.|
|**[[2.5 While & Do-While Loops]]**|while loops; do-while loops; infinite loops; loop conditions; when to use while vs for; loop patterns. Alternative loops.|
|**[[2.6 Loop Control Statements]]**|break statement; continue statement; labels; nested loop control; early exit; skip iteration. Flow control.|
