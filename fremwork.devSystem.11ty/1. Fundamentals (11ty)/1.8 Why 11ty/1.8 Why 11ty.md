| Topic | Focus & Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **[[1.8.1 Performance First]]** | Speed philosophy: static HTML output with zero client-side JavaScript by default; minimal build dependencies; fast cold-start builds; benchmarks vs Next.js/Gatsby/Hugo; Lighthouse scores out of the box. Efficiency. |
| **[[1.8.2 Flexibility & Agnosticism]]** | Freedom of choice: not locked to React/Vue/Svelte; support for 10+ template languages; bring your own CSS/JS tooling; works with any frontend stack; gradual adoption in existing projects. Stack independence. |
| **[[1.8.3 Progressive Enhancement]]** | Web standards approach: building robust HTML-first experiences; layering JavaScript for interactivity; graceful degradation; accessibility by default; resilience on slow networks. Resilient design. |
| **[[1.8.4 The Community & Ecosystem]]** | Support network: active Discord and GitHub community; official plugins (Image, RSS, Navigation, etc.); third-party starters; comprehensive documentation; open-source governance; Zach Leatherman's stewardship. Community. |
| **[[1.8.5 Long-Term Viability]]** | Future-proof choice: built on standard web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS); no framework churn; easy content migration; "The Long Web" philosophy; minimal breaking changes between versions. Stability. |
| **[[1.8.6 When to Choose 11ty]]** | Decision framework: ideal use cases (blogs, docs, marketing sites, portfolios); when NOT to use 11ty (highly dynamic apps, real-time features); comparison with other SSGs (Hugo, Jekyll, Astro, Next.js). Use case fit. |
