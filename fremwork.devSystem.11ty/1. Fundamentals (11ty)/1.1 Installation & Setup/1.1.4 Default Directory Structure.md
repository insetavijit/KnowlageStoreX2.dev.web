| **1.1.4 Default Directory Structure** | Understanding file organization | Input/Output, Includes, Data | Organizing where code lives and where it goes. |
| **[[1.1.4.1 Input Directory (src)]]** | Organizing source code | Configuring `dir.input`; keeping source separate from config; common names (`src`, `content`) | The Input Directory holds your unprocessed source files. |
| **[[1.1.4.2 Output Directory (_site)]]** | Managing compiled assets | Configuring `dir.output`; where the browser-ready site lives; `.gitignore` rules | The Output Directory contains the final, built website. |
| **[[1.1.4.3 The Includes Folder]]** | Reusing code fragments | `_includes` default path; storing layouts, partials, and components; preventing direct output | `_includes` holds reusable bits that don't become pages. |
| **[[1.1.4.4 The Data Folder]]** | Storing global site data | `_data` default path; JSON/JS data files; global availability in templates | `_data` provides global variables to all templates. |
| **[[1.1.4.5 File Resolution Rules]]** | How 11ty finds files | Algorithm for finding layouts; priority of directory data; passthrough copy behavior | 11ty looks in specific places (like `_includes`) by default. |
