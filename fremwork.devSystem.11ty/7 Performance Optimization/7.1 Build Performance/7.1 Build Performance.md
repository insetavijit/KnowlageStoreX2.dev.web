|Topic|Focus & Purpose|
|---|---|
|**[[7.1.1 Build Profiling]]**|Using `cross-env DEBUG=Eleventy:Benchmark*` to inspect build times; identifying slow templates. Diagnostics.|
|**[[7.1.2 Incremental Builds]]**|Leveraging `--incremental`; persisting the cache between builds; skipping unchanged templates. Speed.|
|**[[7.1.3 Template Splitting]]**|Splitting large data collections to reduce looping time; pagination as a build optimizer. Strategy.|
|**[[7.1.4 Caching Remote Data]]**|Ensuring `eleventy-fetch` caches are working; preventing API calls on every build. Resource management.|
|**[[7.1.5 Parallel Processing]]**|Understanding what 11ty does in parallel (writes) vs serial (rendering). Architecture.|
