# 2.5.1 Markdown-it Basics

Eleventy does not write its own Markdown parser. It uses **markdown-it**, a fast and widely used parser that follows the **CommonMark** specification. This ensures that your content behaves predictably and is portable to other systems (like GitHub or VS Code).

Understanding `markdown-it` is essential because it determines exactly how your text file becomes HTML.

## 2.5.1.1 Headings & Structure

Markdown uses hashes `#` to denote headings.

*   `# H1` -> `<h1>`
*   `## H2` -> `<h2>`
*   `###### H6` -> `<h6>`

**Best Practice**:
Always start your file with a single H1. Use H2s for major sections. Do not skip levels (e.g., jumping from H2 to H4) as this hurts accessibility and SEO.

## 2.5.1.2 Formatting Text (Inline)

*   **Bold**: `**text**` or `__text__`. (Recommended: `**` for clarity).
*   **Italic**: `*text*` or `_text_`.
*   **Code**: `` `code` ``.
*   **Strikethrough**: `~~text~~`.
    *   *Note*: Strikethrough is **not** part of the CommonMark spec. It is a GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) extension. By default, Eleventy enables strictly CommonMark, but many starters enable GFM plugins.

## 2.5.1.3 Lists & Indentation

Lists are strict about indentation.

```markdown
*   Item 1
    *   Item 1A (Indented 4 spaces)
    *   Item 1B
*   Item 2
```

**Common Pitfall**: If you indent with only 2 spaces, `markdown-it` might interpret the sub-item as part of the previous line's text rather than a nested list. **Always use 4 spaces for nesting lists** to be safe.

---

## 2.5.1.4 Links & Images

The syntax is nearly identical, differentiated by an exclamation mark `!`.

*   **Link**: `[Link Text](https://example.com "Title Attribute")`
*   **Image**: `![Alt Text](my-image.jpg)`

**Reference Links**:
To keep your text clean, you can define links at the bottom of the file.

## 2.5.1.5 HTML Interop

One of Markdown's best features is that **Markdown is a superset of HTML**. You can write raw HTML anytime.

```markdown
This is markdown.

<div class="alert">
  This is raw HTML. **Markdown inside here might not work!**
</div>
```

**The Block Restriction**:
By the CommonMark spec, content inside block-level HTML tags (`<div>`, `<p>`, `<table>`) is **not** parsed as Markdown. It is treated as raw HTML. To enable Markdown parsing inside HTML blocks, you typically need to add extra empty lines or specific configuration flags in `markdown-it`.

## Quick Reference

| Syntax | HTML | Note |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `**x**` | `<strong>x</strong>` | Strong emphasis. |
| `*x*` | `<em>x</em>` | Emphasis. |
| `` `x` `` | `<code>x</code>` | Inline code. |
| `> x` | `<blockquote><p>x</p></blockquote>` | Blockquote. |
| `---` | `<hr>` | Horizontal Rule. |
