| Topic | Focus & Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **[[2.2.1 Block Definitions]]** | Content slots: defining named blocks in parent templates with `{% block name %}`; providing default content; multiple blocks per template; block naming conventions. Placeholder structure. |
| **[[2.2.2 Extending Templates]]** | Inheritance logic: using `{% extends "parent.njk" %}`; overriding parent blocks in child templates; using `{{ super() }}` to preserve and extend parent content; chaining multiple levels. Child templates. |
| **[[2.2.3 Layout Wrapping vs Inheritance]]** | Architectural patterns: understanding the difference between 11ty's Layout Chaining (wrapping content) and Nunjucks/Liquid block inheritance; when to use each approach; hybrid strategies. Choosing the right pattern. |
| **[[2.2.4 Partial Overrides]]** | Granular control: overriding specific sections while keeping the rest; mixing fixed and flexible areas; conditional block rendering based on data; empty block patterns. Selective customization. |
| **[[2.2.5 Dynamic Inheritance]]** | Advanced structure: using variables in `extends` tags to switch parent templates programmatically; theme switching; A/B testing layouts; computed layout selection. Runtime flexibility. |
| **[[2.2.6 Common Inheritance Patterns]]** | Real-world examples: article layouts extending base; landing pages with alternate headers; admin vs public layouts; multi-language template structures; debugging inheritance chains. Practical patterns. |
