# 2.2.6 Common Inheritance Patterns

While Eleventy gives you infinite flexibility, most successful projects converge on a few proven inheritance patterns. Adoption of these "Standard Architectures" reduces cognitive load and ensures your site scales gracefully from 10 pages to 10,000.

---

## 2.2.6.1 The Base-Page-Post Pattern (The "Classic")

This is the default starting point for 90% of content sites. It is a 3-layer architecture.

1.  **Level 1: `base.njk` (The Shell)**
    *   **Responsibility**: `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, Global Nav, Global Footer, `<script>` tags.
    *   **Blocks**: `title`, `head`, `content`.

2.  **Level 2A: `page.njk` (Generic Wrapper)**
    *   **Extends**: `base.njk`.
    *   **Responsibility**: Wraps content in a standard container (`.container`), adds a standard page title (H1).
    *   **Used By**: About, Contact, Services.

3.  **Level 2B: `post.njk` (Article Wrapper)**
    *   **Extends**: `base.njk`.
    *   **Responsibility**: Article semantics (`<article>`), Metadata (Author, Date, Tags), specialized typography (`.prose`).
    *   **Used By**: Blog Posts, News Items.

This pattern ensures that if you change the analytics script (in Level 1), *every* page on the site updates instantly.

## 2.2.6.2 The "Chrome-less" Landing Page

Marketing landing pages (Splash pages) often need to strip away the "Application Chrome" (Navigation, Footer, Sidebars) to focus the user on a single Call-to-Action (CTA).

**Pattern**: Create `landing.njk` that extends `base.njk` but **empties** the navigation blocks.

**`base.njk`**:
```html
<body>
  {% block nav %}
    <nav>...</nav>
  {% endblock %}
  {% block content %}{% endblock %}
</body>
```

**`landing.njk`**:
```html
{% extends "base.njk" %}

{# Remove the nav entirely #}
{% block nav %}{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
  <div class="hero-splash">...</div>
{% endblock %}
```

This reuses the CSS/JS setup of `base.njk` but visually presents a uniquely focused page.

---

## 2.2.6.3 The "App Shell" vs. "Marketing Site"

For sites that are hybrid (Marketing + Web App), you often need two distinct roots.

1.  **`marketing-base.njk`**: SEO-heavy, large graphics, marketing scripts.
2.  **`app-base.njk`**: Minimal overhead, app-specific scripts, sidebar navigation.

While they are distinct, they might share a common "Grandparent" template (`html-root.njk`) that defines the basic `<!DOCTYPE html>` and viewport settings to ensure consistency even between the two disparate sections of the site.

---

## 2.2.6.4 Multi-Language Structures

For Internationalization (i18n), logic often lives at the layout level.

**`base.njk`**:
```html
<html lang="{{ lang | default('en') }}" dir="{{ dir | default('ltr') }}">
...
```

**`base-ar.njk` (Arabic variation)**:
```html
{% extends "base.njk" %}
{% set lang = "ar" %}
{% set dir = "rtl" %}
```

By defining logical defaults in the base and overriding them in locale-specific wrappers, you avoid duplicating your HTML structure for every language you support.

---

## 2.2.6.5 Debugging Chains

When you have 4 layers of inheritance (`Base -> Section -> Category -> Post`), it can become hard to know *which file* generated a specific piece of HTML.

**The "Comment Marker" Trick**:
Embed HTML comments in your layout files during development.

**`post.njk`**:
```html
<!-- START: post.njk -->
<article>
  {{ content | safe }}
</article>
<!-- END: post.njk -->
```

When you inspect the source code in the browser, these comments clearly delineate where one template ends and another begins, making debugging trivial.

## Quick Reference

| Pattern | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Base-Page-Post** | The default for blogs/content sites. Separation of "Shell" vs "Article". |
| **Empty Overrides** | Removing global navigation for "Splash" or "Landing" pages. |
| **Grandparent Root** | Sharing a DOCTYPE between a Marketing Site and a Web App. |
| **Comment Markers** | Adding `<!-- File Name -->` to output to trace inheritance chains. |
