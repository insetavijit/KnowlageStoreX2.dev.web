# 2.4.5 Jekyll Compatibility

Eleventy is often described as "Jekyll for JavaScript." This is not accidental. Eleventy's Liquid implementation was specifically designed to make migrating from Jekyll (the Ruby-based generator) as painless as possible.

However, because Eleventy runs on Node.js and uses a JavaScript implementation of Liquid (`liquidjs`), there are subtle differences.

## 2.4.5.1 The Shared Heritage

If you have a Jekyll site, you can typically copy your `_includes`, `_layouts`, and content files directly into Eleventy, and they will render.

*   **Front Matter**: Identical (YAML based).
*   **Permalinks**: Identical concepts.
*   **Tags**: `{% if %}`, `{% for %}`, `{% assign %}` behave meaningfully the same.

The primary difference is **Build Speed**. Eleventy is orders of magnitude faster than Jekyll for large sites.

---

## 2.4.5.2 Missing Filters (The Ruby Gap)

Jekyll includes a set of Ruby-specific filters that are not part of the standard Liquid specification. As such, `liquidjs` does not include them by default.

**Common Missing Filters**:
*   `markdownify`: You generally rely on template processing order instead.
*   `absolute_url`: You must create a custom filter for this.
*   `group_by`: Exists in standard Liquid, but Jekyll has a specific Ruby implementation that might differ slightly.
*   `where_exp`: (Where Expression) often needs to be replaced with standard `where` or custom JS logic.

**Solution**:
You can recreate almost any missing Jekyll filter using `eleventyConfig.addFilter()`.

## 2.4.5.3 Include Differences

Jekyll's include syntax is historically quirky regarding quotes.

**Jekyll**:
```liquid
{% include header.html title="My Title" %}
```

**Eleventy (Standard Liquid)**:
```liquid
{% include "header.html", title: "My Title" %}
```

Notice the **quotes** around the filename and the **comma** before parameters.
Eleventy can be configured to "Liquid Options: dynamicPartials: false" to mimic Jekyll's behavior, but it is recommended to update your syntax to standard Liquid.

---

## 2.4.5.4 Data Access (`site.data`)

Jekyll puts all data files into `site.data`. Eleventy puts them into global data objects.

*   **Jekyll**: `_data/users.yml` accessed via `site.data.users`.
*   **Eleventy**: `_data/users.yml` accessed via `users` (Direct global).

To migrate easily, some developers create a `site` global data object that mimics Jekyll's structure, but adopting Eleventy's flatter data structure is usually cleaner.

---

## 2.4.5.5 Strict Filters

Jekyll is notoriously forgiving. If a filter fails or a variable is missing, it often silently ignores it. The `liquidjs` engine used by Eleventy allows you to be stricter.

In your config, you can set `strict_filters: true` and `strict_variables: true` to catch typos that Jekyll would have hidden.
