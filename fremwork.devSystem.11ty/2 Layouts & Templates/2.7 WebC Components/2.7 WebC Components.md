| **[[2.7.1 WebC Setup]]** | Getting started: installing `@11ty/eleventy-plugin-webc` via npm; registering the plugin in `.eleventy.js`; `.webc` file extension recognition; basic configuration options; defining component directories. Installation. |
| **[[2.7.2 Single File Components]]** | Modern components: co-locating HTML, CSS, and JS in one `.webc` file; `<style webc:scoped>` for scoped styles with auto-generated class hashes; `<script>` for client-side behavior; component encapsulation philosophy. SFC structure. |
| **[[2.7.3 Props & Slots]]** | Data flow: passing static and dynamic attributes as props; accessing props via `@attributes`; named slots with `<slot name="...">`; default slot content; `webc:if` for conditional rendering based on props. Component API. |
| **[[2.7.4 Asset Aggregation]]** | Performance loading: bundling Critical CSS and JS from components; `webc:bucket` for grouping assets; `webc:keep` to preserve content; `getCss()` and `getJs()` helpers; accumulating assets across nested components. Asset bundling. |
| **[[2.7.5 Host Components]]** | Advanced usage: `<host>` element for wrapping component output; `webc:root` for semantic HTML; `webc:is` for component aliases; progressive enhancement with `<noscript>` fallbacks; checking JS availability. Component rendering. |
| **[[2.7.6 WebC vs Other Frameworks]]** | Comparison: WebC vs React/Vue/Svelte for static sites; build-time vs runtime rendering; SSG benefits; migration paths; when WebC excels; combining WebC with other template languages. Choosing WebC. |
