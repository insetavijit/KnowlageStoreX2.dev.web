# 2.6.1 The Includes Directory

In Eleventy, the **Includes Directory** is a special folder. Any file located inside it:
1.  Can be referenced by name in `{% include %}` or `{% extends %}` tags without strict relative paths.
2.  Is **automatically excluded** from the build (it won't output a `.html` file even if it's a valid template).

This makes it the dedicated "Library" for your project's reusable code.

## 2.6.1.1 Default Location

By default, Eleventy looks for a folder named `_includes` inside your **Input Directory**.

**Standard Structure**:
```text
src/
├── _includes/
│   ├── header.njk
│   └── footer.njk
├── index.njk
└── about.njk
```

**Usage**:
```html
{% include "header.njk" %} 
<!-- 11ty finds src/_includes/header.njk -->
```

---

## 2.6.1.2 Layouts vs Includes

Historically (Pre-1.0), Layouts *had* to live inside `_includes`.
Modern Eleventy (1.0+) allows you to define a separate `_layouts` directory.

**Config**:
```javascript
module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {
  return {
    dir: {
      input: "src",
      includes: "_includes", // For partials
      layouts: "_layouts"    // For wrapper templates
    }
  };
};
```

This separation is highly recommended for larger projects to distinguish between "Wrapper Shells" (Layouts) and "Injectable Components" (Includes).

---

## 2.6.1.3 Organizing Subfolders

As your project grows, a flat `_includes` folder becomes unmanageable. You should organize it by function.

**Recommended Structure**:
```text
_includes/
├── components/   # Cards, Buttons, Alerts
├── macros/       # Nunjucks Macro files
├── partials/     # Header, Footer, Sidebar
└── svg/          # Raw SVG icons
```

**Usage**:
```html
{% include "components/card.njk" %}
{% from "macros/forms.njk" import input %}
```

---

## 2.6.1.4 Build Exclusion (The Safety Net)

One of the most important features of the Includes directory is safety.

If you have `src/_includes/secret-component.njk`, Eleventy will **never** output `dist/_includes/secret-component.html`. It treats everything in this folder as a partial, destined only to be consumed by other templates.

This means you can safely store complex logic or data-heavy templates here without worrying about them creating "orphan" pages on your site.

---

## 2.6.1.5 Configuring the Path

If you prefer a different naming convention (e.g., `_components` or `library`), you can change it in `.eleventy.js`.

```javascript
module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) {
  return {
    dir: {
      input: "src",
      includes: "library"
    }
  };
};
```

Now `{% include "header.njk" %}` will look in `src/library/header.njk`.

## Quick Reference

| Concept | Default | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Path** | `src/_includes` | The home for reusable code. |
| **Output** | None | Files here are **not** written to `dist`. |
| **Syntax** | `{% include "x" %}` | Looks relative to the Includes root. |
| **Layouts** | `_includes` (Legacy) | Can be separated to `_layouts` in config. |
