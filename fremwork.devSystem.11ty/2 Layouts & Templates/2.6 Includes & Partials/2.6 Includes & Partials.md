| Topic | Focus & Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **[[2.6.1 The Includes Directory]]** | Organization: understanding `_includes` special behavior; configuring `dir.includes` in config; separating layouts from partials; organizing by component type (layouts, partials, components, icons). Folder structure. |
| **[[2.6.2 Passing Data to Includes]]** | Component props: passing variables into partials via context objects; scoped context vs global data; overriding data within includes; Nunjucks `{% include "file.njk", data %}`; Liquid limitations. Data flow. |
| **[[2.6.3 Relative Includes]]** | Path resolution: including files relative to the current template; Nunjucks path behavior; Liquid include paths; avoiding path confusion; using aliases for complex structures. File referencing. |
| **[[2.6.4 Dynamic Includes]]** | Dynamic pathing: using variables to determine which file to include (`{% include variable %}`); switching components based on data; conditional includes; fallback patterns for missing files. Runtime loading. |
| **[[2.6.5 SVG & Icon Systems]]** | Visual components: inline SVG includes for styling control; SVG sprite systems; managing icon assets via includes; accessibility considerations (`aria-*`, `role`); optimizing SVG content. Icon management. |
| **[[2.6.6 Partial Performance]]** | Optimization: understanding include overhead; caching strategies; when to inline vs include; avoiding circular includes; debugging include paths; profiling render time. Efficiency considerations. |
