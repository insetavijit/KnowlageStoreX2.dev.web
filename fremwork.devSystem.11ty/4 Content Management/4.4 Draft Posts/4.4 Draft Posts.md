|---|---|
|**[[4.4.1 Draft Flag]]**|Adding `draft: true` to front matter; ignoring drafts in production builds. Basic gating.|
|**[[4.4.2 Environment Config]]**|Checking `process.env.ELEVENTY_ENV`; enabling drafts in development only. Conditional build.|
|**[[4.4.3 Unified Filtering]]**|Creating a logical filter or collection that handles `draft` status centrally. Clean templates.|
|**[[4.4.4 Scheduled Publishing]]**|Combining `date` checks with draft logic; auto-publishing when date arrives (requires rebuild). Automation.|
