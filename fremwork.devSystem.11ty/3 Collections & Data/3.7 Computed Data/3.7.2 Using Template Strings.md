# Using Template Strings in Computed Data

Computed data supports **template syntax** directly in front matter values. You can use Nunjucks or Liquid expressions to build dynamic values without switching to JavaScript.

---

## The Fundamental Principle: Front Matter Templates

Inside `eleventyComputed`, string values are processed as templates:

```yaml
---
firstName: "John"
lastName: "Doe"
eleventyComputed:
  fullName: "{{ firstName }} {{ lastName }}"
---
```

The `fullName` becomes `"John Doe"` after processing.

---

## Variable Interpolation

Access any data available in the cascade:

```yaml
---
title: "My Post"
eleventyComputed:
  pageTitle: "{{ title }} | {{ site.name }}"
---
```

Here, `title` is local and `site.name` comes from global data.

---

## Using Filters

Template filters work inside computed strings:

```yaml
---
title: "Hello World"
eleventyComputed:
  slug: "{{ title | slug }}"
  upperTitle: "{{ title | upper }}"
---
```

---

## Conditionals

You can embed conditional logic:

```yaml
---
featured: true
eleventyComputed:
  badge: "{% if featured %}⭐{% else %}{% endif %}"
---
```

---

## Page Object Access

Access built-in page properties:

```yaml
---
eleventyComputed:
  canonicalUrl: "https://example.com{{ page.url }}"
  fileSlug: "{{ page.fileSlug }}"
---
```

---

## Multi-Line Strings

For complex templates, use YAML multi-line syntax:

```yaml
---
eleventyComputed:
  structuredData: |
    {
      "@context": "https://schema.org",
      "@type": "Article",
      "headline": "{{ title }}",
      "author": "{{ author }}"
    }
---
```

---

## Combining with Loops

Even loops work (though they can get complex):

```yaml
---
tags:
  - tech
  - tutorial
eleventyComputed:
  tagList: "{% for tag in tags %}{{ tag }}{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}{% endfor %}"
---
```

---

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

**Problem:** Syntax error in front matter.

**Cause:** YAML requires proper quoting around template syntax.

**Solution:** Wrap the value in quotes: `key: "{{ variable }}"`.

---

**Problem:** Filter doesn't exist.

**Cause:** The filter might not be registered or might have a different name.

**Solution:** Check your Eleventy config for registered filters.

## Quick Reference

| Feature | Example |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Variable** | `{{ title }}` |
| **Filter** | `{{ title \| slug }}` |
| **Conditional** | `{% if condition %}...{% endif %}` |
| **Page URL** | `{{ page.url }}` |
| **Global Data** | `{{ site.name }}` |
