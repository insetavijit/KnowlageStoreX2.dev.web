# Directory Data Files: Folder-Level Configuration

Directory data files let you set default values for **all templates in a specific folder**. Instead of repeating the same front matter in 100 blog posts, you define it once in a directory data file.

---

## The Fundamental Principle: Configuration by Convention

Place a specially named file in a folder, and its contents apply to every template in that folder. This is **convention over configuration**—the naming pattern tells Eleventy what to do.

## Naming Conventions

For a folder named `posts/`:

| File | Works? |
| :--- | :--- |
| `posts/posts.json` | ✓ Yes |
| `posts/posts.11tydata.json` | ✓ Yes |
| `posts/posts.11tydata.js` | ✓ Yes |
| `posts/data.json` | ✗ No (wrong name) |
| `posts.json` (outside folder) | ✗ No (wrong location) |

The file must:
1. Be **inside** the folder
2. **Match the folder's name** (or use `.11tydata.` prefix)

---

## Basic Example

**Folder Structure:**
```
posts/
├── posts.json
├── hello.md
├── world.md
└── another-post.md
```

**`posts/posts.json`:**
```json
{
  "layout": "post.njk",
  "tags": ["blog"],
  "author": "Site Admin"
}
```

Now all three markdown files inherit `layout`, `tags`, and `author` without specifying them individually.

---

## Scope: What Gets the Data

Directory data applies to:
- All template files directly in the folder
- By default, **NOT** subdirectories (see Nested Directory Data)

```
posts/
├── posts.json        ← Applies to files in posts/
├── hello.md          ← Gets the data
├── 2024/
│   ├── jan.md        ← Does NOT get posts.json data
│   └── feb.md        ← Does NOT get posts.json data
```

To apply data to subdirectories, you need directory data files in each subdirectory or configure deep merge behavior.

---

## Overriding in Individual Files

Any file can override directory data by defining the same key in its front matter:

**`posts.json`:**
```json
{
  "layout": "post.njk"
}
```

**`posts/special.md`:**
```yaml
---
layout: custom.njk  # Overrides directory data
---
```

Content-level front matter **always wins** over directory data.

---

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

**Problem:** Directory data isn't applying.

**Cause:** File name doesn't match folder name, or file is in wrong location.

**Solution:** Ensure `foldername.json` is **inside** the folder named `foldername`.

---

**Problem:** Subdirectory files don't inherit data.

**Cause:** Directory data only applies to immediate children by default.

**Solution:** Place additional directory data files in subdirectories.

---

## Quick Reference

| Aspect | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Location** | Inside the folder |
| **Name** | Match folder name |
| **Extensions** | `.json`, `.11tydata.json`, `.11tydata.js` |
| **Scope** | Immediate children (not recursive) |
| **Override** | Content front matter wins |
